# Gamblers Anonymous

## Description
Create a website that allows a user/player to gamble their money to try and beat the house. The main drive was understanding how to interface with HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This code allows a user to have fun playing games and winning money. We all learned a lot working on this. The site uses Materilize as the primary CSS framework but some of the games where developed using Bootstrap.
Jacob - When working with javascript you have to be careful when multiplying and dividing numbers and strings. It does not convert the string to a number but instead the number to a string.
Nicholas - How to append code to HTML using Javascript to have a dynamic webpage. How important clear communication is when dealing with groups. Its always talked about but seeing it happen really helps reinforce how useful it is.
Arnasia - This project I learned how to write code in a  feature branch. The process of merging and dealing with conflicts was a headache but the more I had to deal with it the easier I understood what to do. I learned how to work with a group using github. The experience was totally different than working individually. The ability to build something based on a realistic time frame. Its important to have a wireframe to give you a visual of your formatting. Wireframes are excellent references. I experienced hands-on how working as a group communicating pretty frequently is essential to where you are in your project and also helps keep the flow of the process. Overall the experience was a learning process far as code, working with people that are on different levels of one another and trying to get the web to respond in the manner I had in mind. This project took a lot of research. Learning how to read documents really played a huge role in using a css framework for the first time.
